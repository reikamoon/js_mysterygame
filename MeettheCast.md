## Valeria

Valeria always had dreams of becoming famous, so she tried to strike it rich as a famous artist. However, she did not make it big in the art industry, and ended up marrying a wealthy, famous, film director. She lives in the spotlight through him.

Sam's father, who was once a world-famous artist. Although retired, he has dedicated his life to philanthropy, and mentoring budding artists. Mentored the victim, and is an old friend of Valeria's.

<br>

## Dante
### Age: 24
A cold, blunt, man who is protective of his timid younger sister, Katalina. He is Arius's childhood friend. Dante often encouraged him to pursue a different field due to his several art competition failures. He may or may not have unrequited feelings for the party's hostess, Valeria.

<br>

## Katalina
### Age: 20
Unlike her sharp-tongued elder brother, Katalina is meek and polite to a fault. She rarely speaks unless spoken to, and is often found hiding behind her brother. She is currently studying at a prestigious university to be a nurse. Rumor has it she had a "complicated" relationship with the victim.
<br>

<img src="/assets/portraits/Sabrina.png">
<br>

## Sabrina
### Age: 23
A good friend of Dante and Arius. She can be described as a fun-loving gal who's always looking out for her friends. Her hobbies include knitting, blogging, chiding her sourpuss pal Dante and cleaning up after her dim-witted pal Arius's messes.
<br>

<img src="/assets/portraits/Vivian.png">
<br>

## Vivian
### Age: 19
Vivian wears her heart on her sleeve, with pride. She's not afraid to speak her mind, and speaks her mind a LOT. She's Oskar's loyal girlfriend, and doesn't seem to get along well with that grouch, Dante.
<br>

<br>

## Oskar
### Age: 19
Oskar is a famous artist who was winning prestigious art awards since he was a child. Many consider him to be the complete opposite of Arius. He has won every competition he entered except for his most recent one to Arius. His loss doesn't seem to bother him too much...or so he claims.
<br>

<img src="/assets/portraits/Elijah.png">
<br>

## Elijah
### Age: 26
One of your father's mentees. He has aspirations to make it big as a famous artist. It was said he and Arius did not get along, and the fact that Arius had beaten him in the last art competition has caused a greater strain in their relationship. A shameless skirt-chaser.
<br>

<img src="/assets/portraits/Connor.png">
<br>

## Connor
### Age: 26
Connor is a computer programmer and a good friend of Valeria. He is quite the fan of your father's work, and is thrilled to finally meet him in person.
<br>

<br>

## Lena
### Age: 22
Lena is a journalist with a desire to land an interview with at least one of the big shots attending the party. She is a good friend of Elijah's, and is attending as his plus one.
